## Addition

* Updated whole project from Spring-Boot 1.5.x to 2.2.x.
* Therefore the whole MongoDB factory class has changed.
* Added Credentials for MongoDB

## Data Rest

This project is no longer running with the command line runner.
It adds the data rest module from spring-boot to create a rest endpoint of your MongoDB ressources.

Endpoints:

* /first
* /second
